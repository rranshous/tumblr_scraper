we are going to be using the thrift services
for the heavy resource lifting.

those services will be doing the scraping of the site
and the storing of the image meta/data


create code which will:

 read in site list
 scrape the blog site
 search through pages for posts
 search through posts for images
 download images
 save images to tumblrimage service
